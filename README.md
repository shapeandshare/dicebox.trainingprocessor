# dicebox
               Let's shake things up!

Overview
--------
An image classification and training system built with SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture) in mind.  The project includes several client implementations, and future enhancements will continue to expand the API capabilities.

1. **Visual Image Classification**

    Dicebox is a visual classification system.  It can be reconfigured for different image sizes and categories.

2. **Evolutionary Neural Network**

    Dicebox is capable of being applied to a large variety of classification problems.  Sometimes unique or novel problems need to be solved and a neural network structure is unknown.  In this case dicebox provides a means to evolve a network tailored to the particular problem.

3. **Service-Oriented Architecture**
   
*   The trained neural network is accessed through a REST API.  
*   The Web Client (and supervised trainer) stores data to an AWS EFS via the REST API.
*   The Trainer uses the REST API for training data



High Level Components

* **Training Processor Service**

    A back-end service for picking up a training request, and performing the training.

### Production Deployment

**Docker Container**

The recommended way to run the service is by using the official provided docker container.
The container should be deployed to a Docker Swarm as a service.

**Example**
```
docker service create \
--detach=false \
--replicas 1 \
--log-driver json-file \
--name trainingprocessor shapeandshare/dicebox.trainingprocessor
```

How to apply rolling updates of the service within the swarm:
```
docker service update --image shapeandshare/dicebox.trainingprocessor:latest trainingprocessor
```

In the examples above the Docker Swarm was deployed to AWS and had the Cloudstor:aws plugin enabled and active.
The sensory service containers will store and read data from the shared storage.

**Global shared Cloudstor volumes mounted by all tasks in a swarm service.**

The below command is an example of how to create the shared volume within the docker swarm:
```
docker volume create -d "cloudstor:aws" --opt backing=shared dicebox
```
